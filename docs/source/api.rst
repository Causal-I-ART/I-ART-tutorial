The I-ART package provides the `iartest` function for conducting finite-population-exact randomization tests in causal studies, particularly when dealing with missing outcomes. This function is a cornerstone of the I-ART package, enabling the application of design-based causal inference in various research scenarios.

The `iartest` function conducts randomization tests and is designed to handle missing data in causal inference studies. It integrates various outcome imputation algorithms, offers covariate adjustment options, and allows specifying different types of alternative hypotheses. This function is flexible enough to cater to a wide range of research requirements in the field of causal inference.
