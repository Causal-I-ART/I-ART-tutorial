Welcome to I-ART's documentation!
=================================

**I-ART** (Imputation-Assisted Randomization Tests) is a Python package designed for conducting finite-population-exact randomization tests in design-based causal studies, especially those dealing with missing outcomes. It leverages the potential outcomes framework and integrates various outcome imputation algorithms to offer a robust solution for handling missing data in causal inference.

This package is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners in the field of statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and any other domain where causal inference from experimental or observational data is crucial.

For more detailed information on how to install and use I-ART, including its diverse functionalities and practical examples, refer to the :doc:`usage` section.
